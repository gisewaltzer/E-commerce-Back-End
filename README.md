## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, type the following command into the terminal:

npm init -y

npm i

## Usage
After installing necessary dependencies, connect to you schema.sql through mysql, and then type npm start and press the Enter key. Testing was done in insomnia.  You can replace "products" with "tags" or "categories" to search for them instead, and put "/" and a number, i.e., "/2" to retrieve the id 2 in that route.
